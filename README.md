# 🌱 *Plant Disease Classification*  

🚀 An AI-powered application for detecting *plant diseases* from leaf images using *TensorFlow* and *Gradio*.  
This app leverages *fine-tuned deep learning models (ResNet & VGG)* to identify plant diseases with high accuracy.  



# ✨ *Features*  

- ✅ *Disease Classification* – Upload a plant leaf image and get:  
  - Predicted disease name  
  - Confidence score (%)  

- ✅ *Interactive Web Interface* – Built with *Gradio* for easy use.  

- ✅ *Pre-trained Models* – Utilizes *ResNet* and *VGG (fine-tuned)* models.  



# 📂 *Project Structure*  

- app.py : Main Gradio application.  
- requirements.txt : Python dependencies.  
- README.md : Project documentation.  

👉 Models are hosted on *Hugging Face*:  https://huggingface.co/spaces/Vinnu12/plant-disease-predictor
